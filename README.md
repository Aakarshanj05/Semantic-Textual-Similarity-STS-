Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to quantitatively measure the degree of similarity or how they relate to each other.

Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is a natural language processing (NLP) task that aims to quantitatively measure the degree of similarity or relatedness between two pieces of text, such as sentences, paragraphs, or documents, based on their underlying semantic meaning. The goal of STS is to assess how close or similar two texts are in terms of their meaning, rather than just their surface-level lexical similarity.
